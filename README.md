#  SD-Turbo Fine-Tuning with Pok√©mon Dataset + Telugu Prompt Translation

A text-to-image generation project using the powerful [SD-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-turbo) model fine-tuned on a custom Pok√©mon dataset and enhanced with Telugu prompt support via translation.

##  What This Project Does

This project fine-tunes the **Stable Diffusion Turbo (SD-Turbo)** model to generate Pok√©mon-style images from textual prompts. It also supports **prompts in Telugu**, making it accessible for native users by integrating an automatic translation layer.

---

## üí° Why SD-Turbo?

- **Ultra-Fast Inference**: SD-Turbo generates images in a single U-Net step, unlike traditional multi-step diffusion models.
- **High-Quality Outputs**: Even with its speed, SD-Turbo retains impressive image quality.
- **Hugging Face Support**: Easily loadable and extendable using Hugging Face ü§ó Transformers and Diffusers libraries.

## üß™ How Fine-Tuning Was Done

- A Pok√©mon-style dataset was used: [`reach-vb/pokemon-blip-captions`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/reach-vb/pokemon-blip-captions)
- Each data sample includes a Pok√©mon image and a corresponding BLIP-generated caption.
- The model was fine-tuned on **Google Colab (CPU)** by modifying only the **text encoder** using a lightweight approach (e.g., LoRA or selective parameter updates).
- The result is a domain-adapted model that better understands Pok√©mon-related concepts when generating images.

## üåê How Telugu Prompt Translation Is Handled

We added multilingual support using an automatic translation mechanism:

- Telugu prompts are translated to English using a translation library like `transformers`, `googletrans`, or `deep-translator`.
- The translated prompt is passed into the SD-Turbo pipeline to generate images.
- This allows users to give **prompts in Telugu**, while maintaining compatibility with English-only models.
